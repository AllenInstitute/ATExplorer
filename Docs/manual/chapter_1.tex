\chapter{Overview of the \ate{} UI and API}
\section{Introduction}\index{Introduction}

\doublespacing
This chapter gives an overview of the software that is named \emph{ATExplorer}.

The \ate application was designed and implemented due to an emerging need to allow \emph{non-programmers} to process, manage and explore \at data on a routine basis.

Depending on the actual protocols, an \at data set can range in size from a few hundred megabytes, to very large, like several Terra bytes.  Depending on the number of stains and sessions, the complexity of the data-sets range from trivial to complex.

One of the main challenges in \at is the precise digital reconstruction of an original volume, i.e. from individually cut and imaged slices of tissue.

However, before volume reconstruction can begin, various pre data processing algorithms need to be applied, such as median filtering, flat-field correction and de-convolution.

These processing algorithms are all, to some extent, complex. \ate provides the non-programmer user with intuitive and easy to use UI components to guide through this process, in order to quickly get to data that is useful for scientific discovery and exploration.
